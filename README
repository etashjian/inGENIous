To build the project, run make from root directory.

Each server vm runs the Server binary found in the bin folder with a specified port number.
ex. bin/Server 8025

Each server ip address and port number is stored in Configuration/server.cfg for the Client. It is extremely important this information is correct.

The Client binary is run from client machine. The Client program takes three arguments. -n indicates the number of frames to transmit, -w species starting window size, and -q specifies starting queue size. Frames and their receive times are printed to stderr. To generate our logs the following command as used.

bin/Client -n 30000 -w 2 -q 2 2> log

The logs are formated with one frame per line in the follwing format
<Frame receive time in seconds> <frame index>

The logs are run through remove_duplicates.pl scripts found in analysis/data folder to remove any duplicate frames received (this happens on a timeout where a frame is very delayed, but eventually makes it to the client). The final log then has exactly 30000 lines, one for each frame.

All logs can be found in the analysis/data directory. The log files are named with the scenario letter, and the names of the vms that congestion is placed between. For scenarios C and D it uses the vms with 32KBs link between them. Note, there are two version of each log, one appended with _MA, and one without. Our results report data from the logs with _MA appended.
